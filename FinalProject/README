GOAL: Display how organizations and people that protect, raise awareness and educate about human rights 
for people subject to multiple discriminations are getting silenced (posts deleted, shadowbanned) 
on instagram through algorithmic discrimination.

This Program is designed to analyze whether the algorithm that is deployed by the Facebook Group to ensure a "safe space", 
adds to the silencing of peoples voices who are facing multiple discrimination IRL.

Hypothesis: 
The algorithm that seeks to create  a safe space on Facebook Group owned social media Platforms, specifically Instagram,
incorporates inherent biases towards groups that that face multiple discrimination Sexism, queer/trans/intersex imclusive Sex education, 
Racism, cis-Genderdism and Ableism. 
These Biases are somewhat visible in the Community Standards: For example Female nipples being seen as derogatory and banned, 
topics of menstruation declared as fetishising.

Null Hypothesis: The algorithm creates a safer space for all.

Research Questions:
How do social norms that are discriminatory translate into algorithmic discrimination?
How many people who are doing human rights activism through educative or existential(aka showing that they exist) posting have received a “we have deleted this post due to our regulations”  and posted about it compared to the people that haven’t?
Which hashtags are most likely to have been forcefully silenced?
	


Background information: 
- Facebook Group Community Standards 
- multiple people who I follow with my personal account posting about posts having been deleted 



Workflow:
Step 1: Identify the right APIs to receive the information wanted (Posts, Hashtags, Demographics of Users)
Step 2: Get the APIs and Access Tokens
Step 3: write a py file that requests the Data through using the APIs- see if it works 
    DEBUG
Step 4: Analyse Data and create first visualization---- CURRENT STATUS

Step 5: write a Skeleton code for Pipeline
    DEBUG
Step 6: add a MongoDB container and connect it to the PY file so that all the Data is dumped into the MongoDB
    DEBUG
Step 7: write a py file that cleans, explores, analyses and plot the Data
    DEBUG
Step 8: rewrite the filter for etl so that postgresdb can properly connect to it as postgresdg exit on code 2
Step 9: write a sql.script to display the questions in need of Research
    DEBUG
Step 10: create a Dashboard to display the analysis beautifully and properly labeled for presentation
